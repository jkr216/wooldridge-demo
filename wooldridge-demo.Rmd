Attention econ students, professors and aficianados - an awesome new R package has arrived for the fall semester. It's called `wooldridge` and as you might expect, it's a companion R package to the ~~Bible of econometrics~~ popular Wooldridge text used in lots of econometrics classes. Thanks to [@justinmshea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmshea/) for building and contributing to CRAN!

The [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wooldridge/vignettes/wooldridge-vignette.pdf) has a nice summary and worked example from every chapter of the book - here's an excerpt:  

> This vignette contains examples from every chapter of *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge. Each example illustrates how to load data, build econometric models, and compute estimates with R. Economics students new to both econometrics and R may find the introduction to both a bit challenging. In particular, the process of loading and preparing data prior to building oneâ€™s first econometric model can present challenges. The wooldridge data package aims to lighten this task. 

Honestly, the best thing to do is head straight to the vignette but below is a quick worked example from Chapter 10 on time series. 

```{r}
# Load up the data for Chapter 10, example 10.2 and take a look at the summary
data("intdef")
summary(intdef)
```

Now let's run example 10.2 and examine the effects of inflation and deficits on interest rates.

The variable *i3* is the three-month Treasury-bill rate, *inf* is the annual inflation rate based on the consumer price index (CPI), and *def* is the federal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP. The  equation to be estimated is is:

$$\hat{i3_{t}}=\beta_0 + \beta_1inf_{t} + \beta_2def_{t}  + e$$
We will run the same regression as the book and the vignette. The only wrinkle is that we will use the `broom` package to the clean up the results and visualize predicted values.

```{r}
# Run regression
tbill_model <- lm(i3 ~ inf + def, data = intdef)

# tidy the results
tidy(tbill_model)
```

We can `glance` at our results, and use dplyr's `select` verb to choose a handful of columns for viewing. 

```{r}
glance(tbill_model) %>% 
  select( r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma)
```


Let's round out our use of `broom` and tinker with the `augment` function, which will augment our original data set with fitted/predicted values and residuals from the model.

```{r}
intdef_augmented <- augment(tbill_model, intdef)

head(intdef_augmented)
```

Now we can visualize the predicted or `.fitted` versus actual *i3* values. 

```{r}
intdef_augmented %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = i3, color = "i3")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, color = "predicted"))

```


Let's add in our predictors as well and see if anything jumps out as interesting. 

```{r}
intdef_augmented %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = i3, color = "i3")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, color = "predicted")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = inf, color = "inflation")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = def, color = "deficit"))
```


Since 2000, interest rates have been heading in one direction, while the deficit as percent of GDP has been increasing. Remember that our model returned a positive beta for the `def` variable: an increasing deficit should lead to increasing interest rates. This might explain why the predictions are way off after 2000.

That's all for today. Thanks again to [justinmshea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmshea/) for the new fantastically useful [wooldridge](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wooldridge/wooldridge.pdf) package. Happy econometricsing!
